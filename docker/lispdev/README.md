## a container for Common Lisp development

This Docker project builds a container with a
[Common Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp)
runtime and a simple
[SLIME](https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/doc/html/) setup.

The container uses the
[Clozure](https://ccl.clozure.com/)
runtime with
[latest](https://github.com/slime/slime) SLIME running under
[Emacs 25 (Lucid)](https://www.jwz.org/doc/lemacs.html).

The intent of this project is to provide a simple environment for
practicing with Common Lisp. It is meant to be suitable for use in
following the study path laid out in
[A Road to Common Lisp](http://stevelosh.com/blog/2018/08/a-road-to-common-lisp/)
by [Steve Losh](http://stevelosh.com/).
